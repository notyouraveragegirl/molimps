			<P>
				Countries world wide have built legislative laws on
				cybercrime through the United Nations Office on
				Drugs and Crime (UNODC)

				Policymakers around the world concerned about the
				security of people surfing online have made quite an
				effort, For example, Finland's Criminal code Chapter
				38: Data and Communications offences (578/1995)
				sections> 1-2-9: Secrecy offence, Secrecy vioation,
				Data Protection offencefile:///C:/Users/lenovo/Desktop/notyouraveragegirl/images/img2.jpg
				 Secrecy offence
				Summarised: "anyone who violates secrecy and
				discloses secret information For his/her personal gain
				will be sentenced not more than A year or be fined."
				The above fines or puts anyone who exposes secret
				information in prison in Finland the same shared to
				all the other countries that have agreed on this law.
				Since most cyber crimes are about exposition of
				information the law passed is quite effective.

				In the future such laws will not be effective anymore
				since technology will have the ability defy the law
				catching hackers so there should be a bit more
				intensive training and education to police officers who
				specialise in cyber crimes. Cyber criminals and cyber
				police officers should have almost equal knowledge
				so a criminal won't know more and an officer won't
				know less this will make officers technologically
				invincible and criminals easy to catch.

				For the rest of the citizens to find comfort in joining
				the internet of things without the fear of being
				victims to cyber crime there should be safety
				around the internet.

			<p>According to https://www.interpol.int/en
			/Crimes/Cybercrime
			"‘Pure cybercrime’ refers to crimes against computers
			and information systems, where the aim is to gain
			unauthorized access to a device or deny access
			to a legitimate user."

			Apparently cyber crime currently has the fastest
			growing rate in the world where everything is
			automated and computerised. People keep personal
			information, financial information and even
			work-related information on the internet which
			makes them prey to cyber crime.</p>

				<h2>Crime will always prevail but it can be avoided;</h2><br>
				<br>• Increasing the already implemented security
				around the internet.
				<br>• Educating people about what the internet
				really is. Truth is most people just know that
				there is the internet and there is Google and
				Facebook but really do not know what those
				are used for. When someone knows the use and
				importance of something, they are less likely
				to misuse or abuse it.
				<br>• Delegating the power to fight cyber crime to the
				users of the internet. The government is not all
				over the internet all the time, the users are, so if
				they allow users to be the ones to find crime and
				report it, it will make it easier to fight it perhaps
				making an online emergency application which
				a person can use after being victimised or if they
				think they are being victimised, like an internet
				based 911. People will feel more secure surfing
				and have more trust upon the law.
				<br>• Educating about the crimes committed on the
				internet can help users avoid them by not doing
				them or by sensing them from afar if they are
				about to be done on them.
